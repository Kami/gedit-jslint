INSTALLING:

To install just extract the files to ~/.gnome2/gedit/plugins/, make sure its 
not a sub-directory (why oh why does that not work for gedit plugins?!). 


DEPENDENCIES:

It requires spidermonkey and simplejson (and probably some other stuff). On 
ubuntu you can get the packages by:

sudo apt-get install spidermonkey-bin python-simplejson


USAGE:

The plugin should then appear in the Gedit plugins list under 
Edit > Preferences > Plugins. Click Tools > JSLint Check to run it.
